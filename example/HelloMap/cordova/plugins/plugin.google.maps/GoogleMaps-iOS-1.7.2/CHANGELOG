=============================
Features:
  - Styled polylines: additional color options via GMSPolyline, including

    and -groundOverlays

Version 1.6.2 - January 2014
============================
Resolved Issues:
  - Resolved a gesture bug effecting full-screen maps on iOS 7
  - Resolved an issue where overlays were sometimes not initially tappable

Version 1.6.1 - December 2013
=============================
Resolved Issues:
  - Resolved a memory leak involving vector tiles
  - Markers not immediately added to a GMSMapView no longer fail to appear
    when configured at a later point

  - Added the ability to restrict min and max zoom on GMSMapView
  - Added opacity on GMSTileLayer
  - Added opacity on GMSMarker, which may be animated
  ! Updated types within the SDK and used float or double instead of CGFloat
    in cases where it was more appropriate
  ! Core Animation on GMSMapView now requires model values to be set

    GMSMapView and GMSPanoramaView

Version 1.5.0 - September 2013
==============================
Features:
  ! This release officially supports iOS 7, and requires iOS 6.0 or later (iOS
    5.1 is no longer supported).
  ! The 'animated' field on GMSMarker is now known as 'appearAnimation', and
    may be set to kGMSMarkerAnimationNone (default) or kGMSMarkerAnimationPop
  - The Google Maps SDK for iOS now ships with an armv7s slice
  - New features for GMSMarker instances
    * Markers can be made draggable using the draggable property, and new drag
      delegate methods have been added to GMSMapViewDelegate
    * Added GMSMarkerLayer, a custom CALayer subclass for GMSMarker that
      supports animation of marker position and rotation
    * Added support for markers that appear flat against the Earth's surface

    * The UIImage used by GMSMarker now supports the images and duration
      properties, and will animate images with multiple frames
    * The UIImage used by GMSMarker now supports alignmentRectInsets, and will
      adjust groundAnchor, infoWindowAnchor, and the tappable region
  - Added padding on GMSMapView, allowing you to indicate parts of the map that
    may be obscured by other views; setting padding re-positions the standard
    map controls, and the camera and camera updates will use the padded region
  - GMSPanoramaView and GMSPanoramaService now support searching for panoramas
    with custom radius
  - Added cameraForBounds:insets: to GMSMapView, allowing construction of a
    GMSCameraPosition for the map from a specified GMSCoordinateBounds

Resolved Issues:
  - My Location button now clips within GMSMapView
  - Reduced memory usage of GMSMapView through less agressive tile caching
  - Reduced the time taken to obtain GMSServices by moving some startup tasks
    to a background thread; obtaining this object early in your application
    (before creating a GMSMapView or other objects) may improve performance
  - Polylines may now be drawn twice, as required, if they have very large
    longitudinal span

    selector, and set which floor should be displayed
  - GMSTileLayer now supports high DPI tiles, for use on a Retina device
  - GMSMapView.camera is now observable via KVO
  - Added fitBounds:withEdgeInsets: to GMSCameraUpdate

  - Fixed crash bug during memory warning (related to indoor)
  - Fixed crash bug with indoor maps on iOS 5.1
  - Performance improvements when using hundreds of GMSMarkers

    available
  - Updated map design inspired by the new Google Maps
  - Info windows now show at 1:1 resolution on the screen regardless of tilt

  - An improved look and feel for polylines and polygon stroke
  - Added a zIndex property on all overlays; z-indexes are calculated in two
    groups: GMSMarkers and all other overlays
