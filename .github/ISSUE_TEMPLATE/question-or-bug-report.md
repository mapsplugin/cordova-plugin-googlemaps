#--------------------
# public support
#--------------------
Since this plugin project is open source, I give you free public support.
I almost all cases ask you to share your project files on Github or other git repository services.
I don't matter if it is public or private repo.
However screen captures or screen records are posted in public issue thread.
(Code are not discovered as much as possible)

#--------------------
# private support
#--------------------
Even if you don't want to discover anything including screen captures or screen records,
please ask me to private support.
I ask you to donate $100 USD to the maps plugin project,
then I make a private space, then support it.
